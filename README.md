# zedboard_cnn
  Vivado project of hardware Implementation of CNN on Xilinx Zedboard.  
  This CNN system applied on FPGA is able to achieve real-time classification of digits 0~9 with camera module OV7670.
  Achieved an optimized architecture where the computing  time for one image (640*480) is less than 27us and the real-time classification accuracy is above 80% when operating under a clock rate of 100MHz.
